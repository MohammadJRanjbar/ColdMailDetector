# ColdMailDetector
We all know that faculty members are often bombarded with emails, making it tough to keep up with important messages amidst the noise. To help ease this burden, I created a smart email classification tool designed specifically for academics.

This tool acts like a trusty assistant, sorting through incoming emails to identify which ones are genuinely important and which ones can be considered "cold mail." It checks if the sender is familiar with the recipient's work and whether they share research interests, giving faculty members a clearer picture of what deserves their attention.

By automatically forwarding the relevant emails to a dedicated inbox, this project saves valuable time and energy, allowing professors to focus more on what they love—teaching and research—without getting lost in their overflowing inboxes.
